# Dataset Configuration

All configuration of a Quevedo dataset is found in its configuration file, which
is found at the root of the dataset and named `config.toml`. This file is in
[TOML] format, which makes it ideal for both human and machine editing. We
recommend reading TOML documentation to really understand the format, but it is
an intuitive enough language that you can understand the configuration file
enough to modify it just by reading it.

As a convenience, quevedo provides the [`quevedo config`](cli.md#config) command
to edit the configuration file, but this only launches the user's configured
text editor with the `config.toml` file open.

## Local configuration

Quevedo datasets are meant to be shared, and configuration is an essential part
of the dataset. However, some options may be applicable only for the local
environment, and others may be sensitive and best not distributed. For this,
Quevedo also reads a `config.local.toml` if present. The options in the local
configuration file override those in the main file.

This can be useful for the configuration of darknet installation, which is
likely different for different environments, and for the web interface, which
may contain sensitive information like secrets and users' passwords (even if
hashed).

## Annotation schema

Two important options in the configuration file are `tag_schema` and
`meta_tags`. These describe the schema of the dataset annotation, and are lists
of strings with the names of the different tags (features) to annotate.

The `meta_tags` are used to add information to each annotation file, such as
filename, author of the annotation, but also maybe meaning of the transcription,
etc. They are common to both logograms and graphemes.  The tags in `tag_schema`
is a list of the different tags or features that each grapheme, either isolated
or bound, can have. Both meta tags and grapheme tags are represented as
dictionary objects both in the annotation files (in `json` format) and in the
code (python `dict`s).

!!! warning
    In older versions of Quevedo (before v1.1), tags were stored as a list instead of
    a dictionary. If your dataset is using this old structure, Quevedo will warn
    you. Please run the [`migrate`](cli.md#migrate) command to upgrade the dataset.

Isolated graphemes (in the `graphemes` directory) have a single dictionary of
tags associated with the transcription. Conversely, logograms have a list of
graphemes that can be found in them. This list includes the grapheme position,
and also the tag dictionary in the same format and with the same meaning as for
isolated graphemes.

## Other options

- `darknet`: Configuration for using the darknet binary and library. See
    [`Darknet installation`](nets.md#installation).
- `network`: Configuration for training and using neural networks. See
    [`Network configuration`](nets.md#network-configuration).
- `web`: Configuration for the web interface. See
    [`Web interface configuration`](web.md#configuration).
- `generate`: These options guide the process of artificial logogram generation
    used for data augmentation. See [`generate`](cli.md#generate).
- `folds`, `train_folds`, `test_folds`: The `folds` option sets the default
    folds that the [`split`](cli.md#split) will use to partition annotations.
    The `train_folds` option is a list of fold values that will be used to
    train, and the `test_folds` option respectively for testing.
    See [`Splits and folds`](guide.md#splits-and-folds) for more.

## Default configuration

When creating a dataset, Quevedo places a default configuration file with
comments to ease personalization. The default file is included here for
reference:

```toml
# This file is a Quevedo dataset configuration file. Find more at:
# https://www.github.com/agarsev/quevedo

# Local overrides can be written in `config.local.toml`

title = "The title"

description = """ 
The dataset description.
"""

tag_schema = [ "tag" ]
# For a multi-tag schema, use:
# tag_schema = [ "tag1", "tag2" ]

# Meta tags affect the whole annotation, rather than individual graphemes. The
# first one will be used as title for the annotation in the web listing.
meta_tags = [ "filename", "meaning" ]

# Flags are also meta tags, but can only be true/false. They are displayed in
# the web interface as checkboxes with the icon set here.
flags = { done = "‚úîÔ∏è", problem = "‚ö†Ô∏è", notes = "üìù" }

annotation_help = """
Write here any help for annotators, like lists of graphemes or other
instructions. For example:

Make boxes slightly larger than the graphemes, not too tight.
