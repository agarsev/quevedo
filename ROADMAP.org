#+title: Roadmap

* Next (v1.3)

** TODO Improve net and pipe configuration

- [ ] make extend recursive, if extend extends an extension
- [ ] merge instead of replace configs

** TODO Grapheme graphs in the logogram

*** DONE New dataset version (2)
    CLOSED: [2021-12-21 Tue 20:12]

warn: INCOMPATIBLE!

Instead of tag_schema, now there is a schema for grapheme, logogram and edge
annotation (g_tags, l_tags, e_tags). Meta tags stay, both for graphemes and
logograms, they are useful for annotation rather than processing.

- [X] Dataset version, migration, default_config
- [X] Refactor tag_schema to g_tags
- [X] Remove "default" network to use, please always specify one

*** DONE Code representation
    CLOSED: [2021-12-21 Tue 20:12]

- [X] Add `tags` to logograms
- [X] Add Edge class (parent logogram, from, to (indices), tags (dict))
- [X] Add edge list to logogram
- [X] Save and load from json

*** TODO Web annotation

- [X] Separate meta tags and logogram tags
- [X] Annotation mode selection: box draw, grapheme edit, edge edit 
- [X] Drag and drop to create edges
- [ ] Edge tags table
- [X] Save edges in backend
- [X] Improve annotation mode: hide/show/draw toggle for graphemes and edges

*** TODO Edge probability learning

New type of "network" (bayesian network for now, maybe neural in future) that
can be trained and tested.

- [ ] Graph network
- [ ] Prepare -> extract all training edges.
    For each pair of graphemes as <box, grapheme tags according to net config>
    link or not, edge tag according to net config.
- [ ] quevedo optional dep scikit-learn
- [ ] Train -> fit bayesian network, serialize it to disk
- [ ] Test -> load serialized model, for each pair of graphemes in a logogram
    predict edge or not and tag.

How to filter edges? This is global, and probably application dependent. Maybe
a user script? "seed" nodes from where to compute maximum probability spanning
trees?

*** TODO Test

- [ ] Test migration

*** TODO Docs

- [ ] Document new config and dataset version

** Other

*** User configurable colors

The color list to use in the web annotation tool can be configured in the
config.toml.

* Backlog

** TODO Web interface improvements

*** TODO Filter/search annotations in listing according to some tag(s).

*** TODO Autosuggest values for tagging
maybe use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist

*** TODO Improve messaging
Remove "saved" message when doing changes (inconsistent), maybe load indicator

*** TODO Allow deleting entries
Maybe just move the last to the hole?

*** TODO Better mobile interface
Maybe integrate with camera/scan app, make quevedo a target for "sharing"
(uploading) images.

*** TODO Web user improvements
User groups, record annotator in json.

*** TODO Improve CSS

- Add CSS Normalization/reset
- Improve the style

*** TODO Documentation

- [ ] "flags" (from v1.1)
- [ ] changes from v1.2

** TODO Improve use of scripts when modifing images

When scripts modify images, don't save them, but return that it has been
modified (ie return modified_tags, modified_img) and then it is `run_script`
that saves the image to the appropriate path. Coversely, in the web interface
the updated image can be sent to the frontend to be previewed, and if they want
to save it send it back to the server on "save". The complication is that the
image is now frontend state, not just a src link.

** TODO Migrate to alternative ML library

Study migrating to a python-based ML library.

** TODO Data augmentation

Incorporate VISSE code of data augmentation to replace the existing module. The
idea is to use user code to generate examples, because they know how their tags
work. We can still provide the image generation and grapheme placement with
force simulation for logogram generation.

- [ ] Generate graphemes
- [ ] Generate logograms
